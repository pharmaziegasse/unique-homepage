### [](#header-2)About us:

> ***"There is beauty in the unique; there is beauty in every skin!"***

Hello. We are TheUniqueStory. a Startup with an unique approach to skin analysis, designed to help you truly understand your skin and get the right products for your needs.
We are trying to turn skincare consultation into one of the world's most exciting Must-Have. Our founders saw a category that had been ignored, taken for granted, looked over, and dismissed. By creating life into something that had been overlooked, we are igniting a movement of self-discovery and 'savoir-vivre' that has drawn dermatologist, cosmeticians, make-up artists and iconic beauty influencers to the brand - a group we call the Modern Collective. By underpinning our creative roots with a relentless focus on innovation, we have ensured that TheUniqueStory. brings beauty to everyone who dare to be different.

### [](#header-3)Our Mission:
United by difference and tied together by uniqueness, TheUniqueStory. is the first modern collective celebrating and honoring individuality by introducing shoe sizes into the cosmetic industry, which is currently driven by the constraint 'one-size-fits-all'.
Our mission can be translated into these two questions:
Do you know your shoe sizes?
Do you know your skin type?
TheUniqueStory. is as simple as this.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## [](#header-4)Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### [](#header-5)`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### [](#header-6)`npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### [](#header-7)`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### [](#header-8)`npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
